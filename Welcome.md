Hey everyone – this is Spencer Schneidenbach, your speaker du jour at the upcoming Angular 2 and ASP.NET Core workshop!  I’m so glad you are attending and am very much looking forward to meeting you all face to face!

There are just a couple of things that we need to take care of prior to the workshop.  Please read this email carefully – it will help you maximize the value you get out of this workshop.
- About the only thing that this workshop requires is a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  For JavaScript, you should understand the basics of functions, the “this” keyword, prototypal inheritance, and scoping – here is a good resource to get you started.
- This course IS hands on – you will be walking away having spent the whole day writing code.  So please bring your laptop!  PC, Mac, Linux, doesn’t matter.  However, if you want to follow along for the ASP.NET Core part of the workshop, please install:
  - Visual Studio Code – this is the IDE we will be using!  No Visual Studio required!  Download and install it from here: 
  - Node/npm – Node is required to install some of the application requirements.  Download and install it from here: 
- For the first part of the course (the Angular part!) we will be mainly using Plunker to run demos and do exercises.  After that, we’ll be switching to using Visual Studio Code to run and update our ASP.NET project.
- JUST IN CASE the Internet fails at the venue, make sure you download and install Visual Studio Code and Node ahead of time, along with a copy of this repo (Git clone, ZIP, doesn’t matter – just find a way to make it yours!)  You should download it a few days before the conference, as I may be making updates to it up to a couple of days before the conference.

Finally, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

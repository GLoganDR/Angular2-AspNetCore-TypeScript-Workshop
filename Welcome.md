## Angular 2 and ASP.NET Core Welcome Letter

Hey everyone – this is Spencer Schneidenbach, your speaker du jour at the upcoming Angular 2 and ASP.NET Core workshop!  I’m so glad you are attending and am very much looking forward to meeting you all face to face!

About the only thing that this workshop requires is a **working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  For JavaScript, you should understand functions and objects and how they relate, the “this” keyword, prototypal inheritance, and scoping.  Promises and the DOM model would be nice as well, but aren't required.

For the ASP.NET Core part, we'll be going over a lot of the basics, but it would help to know some C#.

**Note that links to all important things are available by going to the workshop page at [angular2.schneids.net](http://angular2.schneids.net).**

### Pre-workshop setup

If you want to follow along with the Angular 2 examples on your computer, please please please make sure you do the following **BEFORE the workshop**!

- Install [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/).  This is a free, lightweight text editor provided by Microsoft.
- Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) - the Recommended For Most Users version.
- Download the code for this repo here - you can either click Download ZIP or clone the repo using Git.  **Note that this repo WILL be updated constantly, so we will be downloading it again at the start of the workshop.**
- Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2BcmpzH5cc) to walk through getting everything setup.

Note that following along and doing the code examples is totally optional, but you will get the most out of this workshop by doing so.

### ASP.NET Core

For the ASP.NET Core part of the talk, if you want to follow along at the workshop you will need to follow some more instructions.  Again, this is optional, but you will get the most out of this by following along with me!

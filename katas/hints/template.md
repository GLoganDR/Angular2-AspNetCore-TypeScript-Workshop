### HINT: Components and template/templateHtml

Component HTML can be stored in the `template` property of the `@Component()` declaration OR added to a separate file and referenced on the component using the `templateUrl` property.

If you use the `templateUrl` property, make sure your URL is relative to the path your app is being served from.
